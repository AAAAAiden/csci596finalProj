**What is the problem: Analysis of the Improved Code**
The Problem in the Original Code
**1. Fork-Join Overhead:**


The original code does not use any parallelization within the MD loop (for (stepCount = 1; stepCount <= StepLimit; stepCount++)). This means all computations, including single_step() and eval_props(), are executed serially. If OpenMP parallelization were introduced incorrectly (e.g., with multiple parallel regions), excessive thread creation and destruction could lead to performance issues.
**2. No Parallelism:**


The lack of parallelism means the computations do not utilize the available CPU cores, leading to inefficient usage of system resources for computationally expensive tasks.


**3. Shared Resource Contention:**


If parallelization were added naively without synchronization (e.g., locks), shared variables like stepCount or other resources accessed in single_step() and eval_props() could lead to race conditions, resulting in incorrect behavior.

**what methods are used**
**1. Single Parallel Region:**

The entire MD loop is enclosed in a single #pragma omp parallel block to avoid excessive thread creation and destruction. Threads are initialized once and reused for the entire simulation.

**2. Dynamic Work Scheduling:**

#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic):
Distributes iterations of the loop dynamically among threads. This helps balance the workload if some steps take longer to compute than others.

**What's Next**

measure the preformance of our code on multiple platforms(i.e Tiber cloud)
